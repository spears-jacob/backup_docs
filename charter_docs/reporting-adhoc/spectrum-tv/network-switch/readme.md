This query answers the first part of the question:
- The number/percentage of customers (by identity) who:
  - Authenticated In-Home and do not move Out-of-Home
  - Authenticated Out-of-Home and stayed Out-of-Home for the entire 30 day period

This is the original request — I think the only piece outstanding is related to average number of days/times in IH or OOH state. We may not need that, but it might point to whether typical behavior tends to push the timeframe boundaries.

Here is what I believe we need — building this story to frame the mobile checking behavior that we currently see in our customer population, drawing implications around how many customers must change behavior with mobile check-in.

- Use a 45-60 day window. OneApp launch was 1-31, so we are not quite yet at 60 days, and there could be a period following launch where data may not be usable, so we would look to you to recommend the best window — we would like to use 30+ days.
- Mobile only
- Aggregated, and by legacy company
- The number/percentage of customers (by identity) who:
  - Authenticated In-Home and do not move Out-of-Home
  - Authenticated Out-of-Home and stayed Out-of-Home for the entire 30 day period
- Moved from In-Home to Out-of-Home, returning to In-Home status at least once during the 30 days, with the average times moving from Out-of-Home to In-Home, or average number of days Out-of-Home
- Started Out-of-Home and moved to In-Home within 30 days, with the average times moving from OOH to IH, or average number of days OOH

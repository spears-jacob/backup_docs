The tableau workbook 'Calls with Visits Dashboard' is refreshed after the job is done:
https://pi-datamart-west-tableau.corp.chartercom.com/#/workbooks/3781/views

Runs on red cluster (pi-qtm-cs-prod-d-red)

https://jira.charter.com/browse/XGANALYTIC-34874 requested that CIR be broken out by application_type and form_factor, for use in the product monthly report. Since this job is fraught with opportunities for financially-impacting errors, I am making a second CIR table until we can get a more permanent solution in place.
